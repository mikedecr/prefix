`prefix` provides ergonomic function names for infix operators (also known as "binary" operators) in R.

Although these operators are already functions---for example, <code>\`+\`(2, 3)</code> returns `5`---they are inconvenient to type and unintuitive to read.

The goal of `prefix` is to provide a more natural functional interface for these operations, similar to functional languages like Haskell and Lisp(s).


## Installation

You can install the development version of prefix like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github("mikedecr/prefix")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(prefix)
## basic example code
```
